The template is created in Adobe Illustrator while the stats are scraped using [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) and parsed with [Beautifulsoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The data is then placed on the template file and exported using [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/).
